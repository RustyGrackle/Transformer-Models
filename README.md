* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Transformer-Models/blob/main/miniGPT.ipynb">miniGPT</a> : I have implemented Decoder Part of Transformer from the research paper "Attention All You Need". I have only used decoder block because, this transformer does the language generation task. We use both encoder & decoder part when we have to do machine translation task.
